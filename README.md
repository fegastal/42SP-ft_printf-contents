# ft_printf
✅ Project score: 109/100 ✅  
The versatility of the printf function in C, the ease of its formatting and its support of diverse types in variable numbers, makes it a really good function to reprogram!  

```c
int		ft_printf(const char *format, ...)
```  
The function ft_printf, mimicking stdio's function printf, writes a string to the standard output. If it's parameter 'format' includes format specifiers (subsequences beginning with %), the additional arguments following format (variadic function) are formatted and inserted into the resulting string replacing their respective specifiers. It returns the number of output characters.  

You can read more about it [here](https://www.dummies.com/programming/cpp/using-printf-for-output/) - this link was my best friend during this project!  

Through this project, I learned the importance of well-structured, readable and extendable code. The nature of this function makes it vital to have a proper plan before you start coding - no brute-forcing your way through this one!  

### It handles the following types:  

| Type specifier | Type                     | Example       | Supported flags                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | ------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| d / i          | Signed decimal int       | –123          | -, +, space, 0, width, precision    |
| o              | Unsigned octal           | 05670         | -, +, space, #, 0, width, precision |
| u              | Unsigned decimal int     | 456           | -, +, space, 0, width, precision    | 
| x / X          | Unsigned hex lower/upper | 89abc / 89ABC | -, +, space, #, 0, width, precision |
| f              | Decimal floating point   | 123.456       | -, +, space, #, 0, width, precision | 
| c              | Char                     | c             | -, width, precision                 |
| s              | Char string              | abcd          | -, width, precision                 |
| p              | Pointer address          | bc080         | -, width, recision                  |
| b              | Binary                   | 10101         | -, +, space, #, 0, width, precision |  

### The flags carry out the following actions:  
| Flag       | Function                                                                   |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| -          | Left justifies output                                                      |
| +          | Precedes positive ints with +                                              |
| space      | Inserts a blank space if no sign is to be written                          |
| #          | Precedes number with 0, 0x, or 0X                                          |
| # (type f) | Includes a decimal point even if the fractional part of the int is zero    |
| 0          | Left-pads ints using zeroes                                                |
| width      | (given as a number) The minimum number of chars to allocate for width      |
| precision  | (given as a number) The minimum number of chars to allocate for precision  |

### The types support the following conversions:
| Conversion |	d / i       | o / u / x / X	     | f           | 
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------------ | ----------- | 
| None	     | int	        | unsigned int	     | double      |
| hh	       | signed char	| unsigned char      | none        |
| h 	       | signed short	| unsigned short     | none        | 
| l 	       | long	        | unsigned long      | none        | 
| ll 	       | long	long    | unsigned long long | none        | 
| L          | none         | none               | long double | 

## How to run it:
Clone the repo and run the executable ./ft_printf (some tests are included in the main). Alternatively, add your own tests to the main.c file, run the command "make re" then run the executable ./ft_printf and repeat to your heart's content!  

Here's a screenshot of some of the output of built-in tests:
